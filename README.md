An implementation of Convolutional Neural Network from scratch using Python ,Numpy and Scipy inspired by Omar Aflak. A from scratch CNN that is capable of classifying hand written digits from the MNIST dataset. 

This from scratch implementation covers:
1) Building a convoltional layer
2) Reshape Layer
3) Loss functions
4) Activation Functions
5) MNIST solution
